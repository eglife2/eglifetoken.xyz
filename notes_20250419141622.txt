Excellent! Here's a full legal and compliance package I’ll prepare for the EGLIFE Crypto Business to make it fully compliant and professionally structured:

I’ll provide you with customized, printable, and professional versions of:

1. Terms & Conditions (for website/app)


2. Privacy Policy


3. AML (Anti-Money Laundering) & KYC Policy

II. Company Compliance Support

I'll guide/document:

Startup India recognition

Bank account setup instructions

---

III. Structured Income Model

I'll create a legally safe income model with:

Referral Bonus (Level 1 to 6)

Staking Plan (as per utility token model)

Withdrawal rules (with TDS/service charge model)

Profit disclaimer


All language will comply with SEBI/RBI/Niti Aayog advisories.

IV. Web & Token Compliance Add-ons

Website Disclaimer Footer (legally required)

Consent checkbox with legal lines before wallet connect

Google Form KYC integration policy

Next Steps

Let’s begin with the first set of legal documents (Terms, Privacy, KYC/AML, and Token Disclaimer). I’ll provide them in both:

Web-ready format (to paste on website)

PDF format (to keep as records)


Confirm: Shall I start with English only, or do you want bilingual format (English + Hindi)?
